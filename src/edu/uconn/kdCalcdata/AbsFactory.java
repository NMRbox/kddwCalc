// ArrayList of paths to object
// ArrayList of ligand concentrations
// ArrayList of receptor concentrations
// multiplier - the value for scaling the two nuclei

// important note:
// for the three ArrayList objects, each index matches the same
// indicies for the other two. for instance, index[0] has the 
// receptor and ligand concentrations and the chemical shifts for
// the first titration point. these are the data from teh first line of the
// GUI that requests the data
