// 
// important note:
// for the three ArrayList objects, each index matches the same
// indicies for the other two. for instance, index[0] has the 
// receptor and ligand concentrations and the chemical shifts for
// the first titration point. these are the data from teh first line of the
// GUI that requests the data
*
* edited by Alex Ri on 170704 to use a Template method to create the dataset.
